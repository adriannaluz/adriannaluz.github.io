## About me
I am Venezuelan and Spanish. I studied Physics in Caracas (Venezuela). I did a Master in Astroparticle Physics in Barcelona (Spain). I came to Germany in 2018 to work at the RWTH Aachen University as Scientific Research Assistant. I speak fluently and actively three Languages.

## Education
- M.S., Astroparticle Physics. University of Barcelona. Barcelona, Spain (_2017_)	 			        		
- Licenciate in Physics. Simón Bolívar University. Caracas, Venezuela (_2016_)

## Work Experience
**Data Analyst & Data Engineer Intern @ Women AI Academy. Munich, Germany (_2023 - Present_)**
- Built ETL data pipelines using SQL, AWS, python, docker, and Airflow
- Pre-processed and prepared big datasets (thousands of records) for anal-
ysis
- Performed Customer Segmentation analysis using Machine Learning
algorithms
- Visualized findings on PowerBI, and Tableau

**Scientific researcher @ RWTH Aachen University. Aachen, Germany (_2018 - 2020_)**
- Assembled ETL pipelines to download, store, clean, and pre-process the cosmic-ray
air shower data measured at the [Pierre Auger Observatory](https://www.auger.org/) in Argentina
- Simulated cosmic-ray air shower data with [CORSIKA](https://www.iap.kit.edu/corsika/)
- Analyzed and validated of the simulated data
- Developed software solutions with Python and C++ for simulations, ETL pipelines, and data analysis
- Implemented AI models (Random Forest and Deep Learning) for classification
- Structured and supervised different analysis projects in the research group,
including Bachelor and Master students
- Published and presented insights on international conferences (e.g. in Argentina, USA, and Poland) in the field of astroparticle physics and data analysis.
- Supervised for Bachelor and Master courses
